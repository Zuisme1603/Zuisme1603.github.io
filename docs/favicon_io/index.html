        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>Hello there! My name is Vu Huynh but also can call me Eric, I'm currently majoring in Computer Programming and Analysis at Humber College. I was born in the South of Vietnam, which is Ho Chi Minh city. I moved to Canada month ago I love the resident here and excited to adapt in a multi-culture environment also the education in Canada.</p>
        <p>Initially, I was not interested in computer-based and I used to be tech illiterate because I rarely use computer to work or study, even play video games. later on, I was attracted by a STEM class that I have attended in and there is a coding for robots, which you apply a block of code in order to activate the action of the robots like walking, running,.. I enjoyed that class a lot so that I decided to dig deeper into a programming feild. </p>
        <p>Besides programming, I also spent my meantime to play football and basketball. Additionally, I used to be a part of my highschool football team and also a coach for secondary but it's already a years ago and I hadn't played for while, If I have a chance I will participate in to express my passion and desire.</p>

        <div>
        <p>I enjoy coding but if its unencouraging then the process will not efficient. So to solve that problem I have tried many sources and pulled out my TOP 3, which can be useful during absorbing codes.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3school</a> is one of the top tier website I would choose when I first writing code, this website provide lecture and specific example that every beginner will need.</p>
        <p>Next up are <a href="https://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a> and <a href="https://grasshopper-yz.netlify.app/">Grasshopper</a>, these two website are a perfect place to practice coding after learning the lecture and have specific solutions. Moreover, it's also have different level from easy to hard and interview question that related to our future work.</p>
